# Jarvis

Jarvis is a Windows desktop AI assistant foundation. Phase 1 provides the application shell. Phase 2 adds a safe voice foundation for local microphone diagnostics and provider interfaces only.

## Phase 1 Scope

- PySide6 desktop window with a dark floating Jarvis-style interface.
- System tray icon with show and exit actions.
- Manual command input.
- Status states: Sleeping, Listening, Thinking, Speaking, Error.
- Pydantic Settings configuration from `.env`.
- Loguru logging to `logs/jarvis.log`.
- Assistant core stub that returns a safe placeholder response.
- Basic pytest coverage.

## Phase 2 Scope

- Microphone device detection using `sounddevice`.
- Short local microphone stream test with average and max RMS level reporting.
- RMS-based VAD interface for diagnostics only.
- Speech-to-text provider interface only.
- Text-to-speech provider interface.
- Optional local `pyttsx3` placeholder TTS provider.
- `py main.py --audio-check` diagnostic command.
- GUI `Mic Test` button and tray menu action.
- Audio logging through Loguru, including `logs/audio_diagnostics.log`.

## Phase 3 Scope

- Faster Whisper dependency support.
- `faster_whisper` speech-to-text provider.
- One-shot transcription diagnostic command.
- Short microphone recording using configured voice settings.
- STT diagnostic logging to `logs/stt_diagnostics.log`.
- Graceful error output if Faster Whisper or the model cannot load.

## Phase 4 Scope

- Wake phrase configuration.
- Wake phrase aliases.
- Fuzzy wake phrase matching with `difflib.SequenceMatcher`.
- Wake detection utility class.
- One-shot `py main.py --wake-test` diagnostic command.
- Wake diagnostic logging to `logs/wake_diagnostics.log`.

## Phase 5 Scope

- Controlled voice command test mode.
- One wake phrase recording.
- One command recording only after wake detection succeeds.
- Command transcription routed to the existing `AssistantCore` stub.
- CLI command: `py main.py --voice-command-test`.
- GUI and tray action: `Voice Command Test`.
- Voice command logs saved to `logs/voice_command_test.log`.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```powershell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional local configuration:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Do not add API keys in Phase 1. Future provider keys will be added only when the relevant phase is approved.

## Run

```powershell
py main.py
```

Type a command in the input box and press Enter or Send. Jarvis will echo a safe placeholder response until the real assistant runtime is added in a later phase.

Use the `Mic Test` button or tray menu action to run a short local microphone test.

## Audio Check

```powershell
py main.py --audio-check
```

The diagnostic prints available input devices, default microphone name, configured sample rate, whether the microphone stream opened, max RMS level, VAD threshold result, suggestions, and whether local `pyttsx3` TTS is available.

Voice diagnostic settings:

```dotenv
VOICE_SAMPLE_RATE=16000
VOICE_RECORD_SECONDS=5
VOICE_VAD_THRESHOLD=0.0015
```

Detailed audio diagnostic logs are saved to:

```text
logs/audio_diagnostics.log
```

## Transcription Test

```powershell
py main.py --transcribe-test
```

The command records one short microphone clip and sends it to Faster Whisper. It prints the provider, model, device, compute type, recording level, VAD result, transcription text, and any errors.

Speech-to-text settings:

```dotenv
STT_PROVIDER=faster_whisper
WHISPER_MODEL=base.en
WHISPER_DEVICE=cpu
WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8
```

Detailed STT diagnostics are saved to:

```text
logs/stt_diagnostics.log
```

## Wake Test

```powershell
py main.py --wake-test
```

The command records one short microphone clip, transcribes it with Faster Whisper, and checks whether the transcript matches the configured wake phrase or aliases.

Wake settings:

```dotenv
WAKE_PHRASE=hey jarvis
WAKE_ALIASES=hey jarvis,hi jarvis,wake up jarvis,jarvis wake up,okay jarvis,yo jarvis
WAKE_MATCH_THRESHOLD=0.72
WAKE_LISTEN_SECONDS=5
```

Detailed wake diagnostics are saved to:

```text
logs/wake_diagnostics.log
```

## Voice Command Test

```powershell
py main.py --voice-command-test
```

The command runs one controlled voice command flow:

1. Records a wake phrase clip.
2. Transcribes the wake phrase.
3. Checks the transcript against the wake phrase and aliases.
4. If wake is detected, records one command clip.
5. Transcribes the command.
6. Sends the command text to the existing `AssistantCore` stub.
7. Prints the placeholder Jarvis response.

Detailed voice command logs are saved to:

```text
logs/voice_command_test.log
```

## Test

```powershell
py -m pytest
```

## Not Implemented Yet

Jarvis still does not include continuous always-on listening, OpenAI calls, memory, Gmail, Calendar, browser automation, desktop automation, file tools, or vision.
